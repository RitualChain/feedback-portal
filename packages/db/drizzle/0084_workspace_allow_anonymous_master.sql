-- Collapse the three workspace-level anonymous-access toggles
-- (`features.anonymousVoting`, `features.anonymousCommenting`,
-- `features.anonymousPosting`) into a single master switch
-- `features.allowAnonymous`.
--
-- Preserving end-user behaviour requires two passes:
--   1. Bump per-board access tiers: any action whose workspace flag was
--      false AND whose board tier was 'anonymous' is raised to
--      'authenticated'. This way the ceiling that the workspace used to
--      enforce as a kill switch is now reified in the per-board tier,
--      and we can default `allowAnonymous=true` without re-enabling
--      anonymous interaction on boards the admin had locked down via
--      the workspace toggles.
--   2. Rewrite `features`: drop the three legacy keys, set
--      `allowAnonymous=true`. The default is `true` because the per-
--      board bump above has already encoded any prior restrictions.
--
-- Mapping (workspace flag ↔ board action):
--   anonymousVoting     ↔ vote
--   anonymousCommenting ↔ comment
--   anonymousPosting    ↔ submit
--
-- `view` is never restricted at the workspace level today, so its tier
-- is left untouched.
--
-- `settings.portal_config` is stored as `text` (JSON serialised — see
-- migration 0000), so each read casts through `::jsonb` and each write
-- casts back to `::text`. `boards.access` is native `jsonb`.
--
-- The CTE materialises the old flags from the single-tenant settings
-- row, defaulting absent keys to `true` to match the in-app fallback
-- (`?? true`) — so a workspace that never explicitly set a flag also
-- never has its boards bumped.
